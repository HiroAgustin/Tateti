> A simple game of Tic Tac Toe

When I applied to Hacker School, I was told to build something simple, *“like a game of tic tac toe”*. So [I did just that](http://codepen.io/HiroAgustin/pen/ArfhH), and then I decided I wanted to take it a step further.

Using Node.js and Socket.io, I created this Web Application that allows users to play Tic Tac Toe against each other.
